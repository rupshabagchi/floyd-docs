Follow this guide to learn how to spin up a Jupyter Notebook on FloydHub's deep-learning servers.

## Quick Preparation Checklist

- You must have a [FloydHub account](https://www.floydhub.com/login)
- You must have `floyd-cli` [installed on your computer](../guides/basics/install.md)
- You must [log in to FloydHub through the CLI](../guides/basics/login.md)


## Quick Start

1. Visit https://www.floydhub.com/projects/create and create a FloydHub
   project:
   ![create jupyter notebook](../img/create_jupyter_project.jpg)

2. In your terminal, use Floyd CLI to initialize the project (be sure to use
   the name you gave the project in step one):

    ```
    $ floyd init my_jupyter_project

    Project "my_jupyter_project" initialized in current directory
    ```

3. Then, kick off your first Jupyter Notebook with
    `floyd run --gpu --mode jupyter`

    ```
    $ floyd run --mode jupyter

    Creating project run. Total upload size: 198.0B

    Setting up your instance and waiting for Jupyter notebook to become available .............

    Path to jupyter notebook: https://floydlabs.com/notebooks/gaftzXTdaPtQtQ9NvEieNg
    ```

    This will open up a Jupyter Notebook in your browser. The notebook is
    running on FloyHub's GPU servers. Just like that, you're up and running!

Congratulations! You've just started your first Jupyter Notebook on FloydHub ðŸŽ‰
